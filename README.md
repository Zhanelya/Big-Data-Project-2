# Big Data Project 2
###Community detection with a use of Hadoop MapReduce algorithm

Community detection is the process of finding communities within an arbitrary network through computational algorithms. In general, community detection provides a means of uncovering organizational principles within networks. This is valuable in revealing not only the network structure, but also the relationship between interacting nodes.
Working in a group of 4, in this project we were tasked to find communities within a twitter dataset. To search for the strongly connected components we decided to look at the Bi-Directional Label Propagation Algorithm (Lv and Xie, 2012).
